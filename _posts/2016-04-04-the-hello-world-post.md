The "Hello World" Post!

World, meet Damn Designs. We have been long time travelers, hikers, motorcyclists and adventurists, who found it very difficult to find really good products and services to fuel our passions. So as it is generally said... The necessity gave birth to invention (innovation would be more apt here)! We found it immensely satisfying and easier to build our products as per our needs in this part of the world where the products built for elsewhere do not fulfill all our needs.

Our journey would be to create inspiring products for adventure purists and introduce the idea of Unbound Adventure to like-minded people here in the home of the Himalayas and the mighty Rivers.

We believe we already are on the right path!
